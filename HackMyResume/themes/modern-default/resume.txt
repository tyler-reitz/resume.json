================================================================================

Tyler hails from Los Angeles, CA. He has earned degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, General Assembly, and Bloc.io. While his work focuses on front-end development, mostly on focusing on Javascript and React and the blazing speed at which the accompanying ecosystem changes, his non-work interests range widely, including everything from machine learning to lean startups. He could tell you about it, but THAT would be better left for when we meet!
